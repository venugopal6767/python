#Task 1: Arithmetic Operators
# Create two variables a and b with numeric values.
# Calculate the sum, difference, product, and quotient of a and b.Print the results.
a = 3
b = 2
sum = a + b 
print (sum)

difference = a - b
print(difference)

product = a*b
print(product)

quotient = a/b
print(quotient)


# Task 2: Comparison Operators
# Compare the values of a and b using the following comparison operators: <, >, <=, >=, ==, and !=.
# Print the results of each comparison.
a=3
b=2
print(a==b)
print(a != b )
print(a<b)
print(a>b)
print(a<=b)
print(a>=b)




# Task 3: Logical Operators
# Create two boolean variables, x and y.
# Use logical operators (and, or, not) to perform various logical operations on x and y.
# Print the results.

x = True
y = False

print(x and y)
print(x or y)
print (not x)
print(not y)


# Task 4: Assignment Operators
# Create a variable total and initialize it to 10.
# Use assignment operators (+=, -=, *=, /=) to update the value of total.
# Print the final value of total.

a = 10
a -= 2
a *= 2
a /= 2
print (a)
